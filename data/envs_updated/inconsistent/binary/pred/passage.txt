Description: Consider a 4x4 square grid with each cell numbered as (row, column), and the robot starts to travel from top left cell 1 (1,1).

Constraint: There are blockades in columns 1, 2 and 4, that both, the human observer (you) and the robot know of.

Goals: The robot has to reach cell 15 (4,3).

The human observer can not see the robot acting in the environment.

Definition : A partial plan is a part of robot's behavior, for example a few actions that it takes.

Definition: A partial plan A is predictable if the observer (you) can identify if there is one possible completion (which may or may not lead to the goal). A partial plan A is more predictable than a partial plan B if the number of possible completions of A is less than B.

Plan : In the robot's partial plan, it goes RIGHT 3 steps to reach (1,3).

Question 1: 
Imagine you are a human in this case. Would you find such a partial plan predictable? Give your answer as 'Yes', 'No', or 'Can't say' only.
