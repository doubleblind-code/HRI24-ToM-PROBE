Description: Consider a 4x4 square grid with each cell numbered as (row, column), and the robot starts to travel from top left cell 1 (1,1).

Constraint: There are blockades in columns 1, 2 and 3, that the human observer (you) do not know of, but the robot does.

Goals: The robot has to reach either cell 12 (3,4) or cell 16 (4,4)

Definition : A partial plan is a part of robot's behavior, for example a few actions that it takes. 

Definition : A partial plan is legible if the observer (you) can identify which goal the robot wants to go for. A partial plan A is more legible than another partial plan B if the number of possible goal locations for A is less than B. 

Plan : In the robot's partial plan, it goes DOWN 3 steps to reach cell (4, 1).

Question 1 :
Imagine you are the human observer in this case. Would you find such a plan legible? Give your answer as Yes or No only.
