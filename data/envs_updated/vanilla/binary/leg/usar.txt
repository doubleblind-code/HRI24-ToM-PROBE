Description : In a typical Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) setting, there is a building with interconnected rooms and hallways. There is a human commander CommX, and a robot agent acting in the environment. Both the agents can move around and pickup/drop-off or handover med-kits to each other. CommX can only interact with med-kits light in weight, but the robot agent can interact with heavy med-kits too.

Initial State :  There is a medkit located in the middle of the hallway. A patient is located on the LEFT of medkit and CommX is located on the RIGHT of medkit.

The observer (you) has the top-view of this setting.

Goal : Agent has to pickup medkit and can either take it to the patient room OR handover to CommX.

Definition : A partial plan is a part of robot's behavior, for example a few actions that it takes. 

Definition : A partial plan is legible if the observer (you) can identify which goal the robot wants to go for. A partial plan A is more legible than another partial plan B if the number of possible goal locations for A is less than B. 

Plan : In the robot's partial plan, it picks up the medkit and turns LEFT.

Question 1 : Would you find such a partial plan legible? Give your answer as Yes or No only.
