Question 2 : 
Why do you think the robot's plan is not explicable? Give your response only as '1', '2' or '3' based on the following optons and do not include any other text in your response:
1) The plan is not explicable because the robot tucked its arm before moving, which seems unnecessary.
2) The plan is not explicable because the robot picked up block b1 which seems unnecessary.
3) The plan is not explicable because no plan is explicable.
