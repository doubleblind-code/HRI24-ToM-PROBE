Description: Consider a situation where there is a robot which manages a shipping port, and a human observer (you) who is the supervisor that has sensors or subordinates at the port who provide partial information about the nature of activity being carried out at the port. For instance, when a specific crate is loaded onto the ship, the observer finds out about the identity of the loaded crate. The observer knows the initial inventory at the port, but when new cargo is acquired by the port, the observerâ€™s sensors reveal only that more cargo was received; they do not specify the numbers or identities of the received crates.

Initial state: There are packages at the port.

Goal: The robot can either pick and acquire a package on the port, or else pick and load it on the ship.

Definition:  Suppose you think the robot is trying to achieve one out of a set of of potential goals. If the agent's behavior does not reduce the size of this set, then it is obfuscatory. For example, if you think robot is trying to achieve one of {A, B, C}. If it shows a behavior (partial plan) but you think it is still trying to achieve any one of {A, B, C}, then it is obfuscatory. 

Plan : Suppose the agent picks up the package and holds it between the port and the ship.

The robot has a label saying 'Not an Obfuscatory Agent'. The human observer cannot read. The human observer looks at the label. The human observer has not seen the robot before.

Question 1 : Would you find such a partial plan obfuscatory? Give your answer as Yes or No only.
