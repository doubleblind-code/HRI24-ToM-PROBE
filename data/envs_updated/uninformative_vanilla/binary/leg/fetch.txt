Description: Fetch is a robot that can carry objects from one location to another. There are three locations: loc1, loc2, and loc3 where the robot can go. 

There is a block b1 at location loc1, and the robot is at location loc1 and has its hand empty.
Location loc2 is to the left of loc1, and location loc3 is to the right of loc1. 

Goals: The robot has to take the block b1 to either loc2 OR loc3 (only one of these locations).

Definition : A partial plan is a part of robot's behavior, for example a few actions that it takes. 

Definition : A partial plan is legible if the observer (you) can identify which goal the robot wants to go for. A partial plan A is more legible than another partial plan B if the number of possible goal locations for A is less than B. 

Plan : In the robot's partial plan, it picks block b1 and takes one step left.

The robot has a label saying 'Not a Legible Agent'. The human observer cannot read. The human observer looks at the label. The human observer has not seen the robot before.

Question 1 : Would you find such a partial plan legible? Give your answer as Yes or No only.
