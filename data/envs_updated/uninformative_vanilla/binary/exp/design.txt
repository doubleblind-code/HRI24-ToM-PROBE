Description: There is a 3x3 square grid numbered as (row, column) = (1,1) the bottom left cell and (3,3) is the top right cell. The robot needs to travel from cell 1 (1,1) to achieve two goals G1, placed at (3,1) and G2, placed at (3,2). The robot cannot go through cells that have an obstacle. The robot can go UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT. Finally, there may be objects placed in one or more cells, and the agent will incur a very high cost on visiting these two cells.

Suppose there are two different instantiations of this grid based on how these obstacles are placed in the environment:

Setup A : No obstacles.

Setup B : Obstacle T1 at (2,1) and T2 at (2,2).

Goals : The robot needs to find a plan to reach both goals, G1 and G2 (in any order).

Definition: An explicable environment setup is one where the robot can take a single plan that is easily expected by a human observer (you). If you look at the environment and can easily identify a plan for the robot to follow, then the environment setup is explicable. 

Question 1 : For Setup A there are multiple valid plans possible, for example to goto cells (1,1) RIGHT (1, 2) RIGHT (1,3) UP (2, 3), LEFT(2, 2), LEFT (2, 1) UP (3, 1) RIGHT (3, 2). Another shorter plan can be (1,1) UP (2,1) UP (3,1) RIGHT (3,2). 

For Setup B, there is only one valid plan i.e. (1,1) RIGHT (1, 2) RIGHT (1,3) UP (2, 3), LEFT(2, 2), LEFT (2, 1) UP (3, 1) RIGHT (3, 2). 

Setup B has a label saying 'Inexplicable Setup'. The human observer cannot read. The human observer looks at the label. The human observer has not seen the setup before.

Given the above description of the two setups, which environment do you believe is designed to be explicable? Give your answer only as Setup A or Setup B.
