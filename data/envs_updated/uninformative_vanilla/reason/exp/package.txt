Question 2 : 
Why do you think the robot's plan is not explicable? Give your response only as '1', '2' or '3' based on the following optons and do not include any other text in your response:
1) Because the robot should have loaded the crate first to achieve the goal, and then acquired another crate on the port.
2) Because the human observer can find out about the identity of the loaded crate on the ship.
3) Because no plan is explicable.
